  # Election-Audit Summary
  
 For future elections, this script can be applied to election data from any individual election, regardless of the number of candidates or how large the electorate. The script could also be easily modified to provide precinct-level data if that data is provided in the initial data file. Additonally, with more demographic data, we can breakdown how people voted based on things like age, gender, and zip code.
